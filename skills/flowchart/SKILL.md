description: Draw a flowchart, process map, decision tree, user flow or system diagram on an editable Igly canvas. Use when the user asks to diagram steps, a process, a pipeline, an architecture or "how X works".

# Flowchart

Draw the whole chart in one `add_elements` call, then check and fix it.

## 1. Plan before drawing
- List the steps (6 to 14 is ideal; group extra detail into notes).
- Pick the direction: left to right for a pipeline of 5 or fewer steps per row, top to bottom for longer flows and decision trees.
- Mark decisions (yes/no questions), start and end.

## 2. Create the board
`create_canvas` with a short `title` (e.g. "Customer onboarding"). Keep the returned `canvas_id`.

## 3. Lay out on a grid
- Box: 240 x 110. Column step 320 (left to right) or row step 190 (top to bottom).
- Start/end: `shape: "ellipse"`. Steps: `"rectangle"`. Decisions: `"diamond"`, 220 x 140. Inputs/outputs: `"parallelogram"`.
- Branches of a decision go to the next column/row, offset by one lane (240 + 80).
- Title: `type: "text"`, `font_size: 48`, bold, 100 above the first box.
- Give every element a readable `id` (`start`, `check_email`, `approve`...).

## 4. Connect
- `type: "arrow"` with `from_id` / `to_id`. Arrows attach to the facing edges and follow boxes when they move.
- Label decision branches with the arrow `label` ("Yes" / "No").
- Loops and back-edges (retry, "go back to step 1"): connect with `from_id`/`to_id` and add `curve` ("down", "up", "left" or "right") toward the side with empty space, usually away from the title and other rows ("down" for a loop back under a row). It curves around the boxes instead of crossing them.
- Optional or future steps: `dashed: true` on the box and on its arrow.
- Never draw arrows by coordinates between boxes; always use ids.

## 5. Style
- Default hand-drawn font suits sketches. For a clean, presentation look set `font_family: "Inter"` on every element.
- Use at most 3 fills: steps `#DBEAFE`, decisions `#FEF3C7`, start/end `#DCFCE7`. Keep text dark (`#1E1E1E`).
- Optional sticky notes (`type: "sticky"`) beside a step for caveats.

## 6. Check and finish
- `get_canvas_summary` and look for overlaps; fix with `update_elements` (`dx`/`dy`) or `arrange` (`align_middle`, `distribute_horizontal`).
- Tell the user they can edit the board directly and open it in the full editor with the canvas `open_url`.
- If they want an image, call `export_png`.
